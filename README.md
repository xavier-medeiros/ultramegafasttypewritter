# ultramegafasttypewritter

//Project Description

This was our second project @ <Academia De Código_> #69 Bootcamp @Terceira.
We were challenged to create a game by applying the program philosophies that we previously learned from the past few weeks. Deadline project deployment: Full Weekend including Friday!!!!

//The idea

During the Code Break, we had a brilliant idea of creating a typewrite racer.

//Development

The game consisted in 4 players, where each player receives a random word each round in a total of 15 rounds , each player has to type the word as fast as they can, but of course it wouldn´t be that easy. We made it harder, some rounds, there were words backwards and some the first letter and last letter were swapped.
So to make all of this come true, we used the promt-view library to create the menu's and to show each word after the player wrote it correctly.
And to be able to deploy it online, we used what we have learned on WebServer exercises that we did before and we used multithreading so everyone could play it at the "same time".


//Tech & Methodologies
